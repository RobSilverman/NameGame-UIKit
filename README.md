# NameGame-UIKit

## About the Project

This project was created as an interview project for [WillowTree](https://willowtreeapps.com/). I built this final version using UIKit, but I did some exploratory work on a [SwiftUI version](https://github.com/RobSilverman/NameGame-SwiftUI) as well!

## Usage

This project was built in UIKit with no added packages. The designs require a SFSymbols 2 image, so it is targeting iOS 14.

You can customize the length of Timed Mode games by changing the `gameLength` property in `TimedModeGame.swift`.

## Roadmap

If I had more time to focus on this project, some of the first things I'd continue to improve would be:
* Auto-layout improvements- portrait views are working well but adapting to landscape (with different layouts depending on size class) has proven challenging.
* Refactor view controllers- I architected the view controllers to be functionally identical so that with a little more learning, they could be a single view controller with replacable controllers.
